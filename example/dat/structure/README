# Format of structure files

>>>>> files for training RNAs

Structure files is in standard CT format and with a .ct suffix in names. 

The first line indicates the length and name of RNA. Other lines provided the index, structure and structure of each base. 6 columns seperated by several blanks is required except for the header line.

Example: 

  608  yeast.rRNA_RDN18-1_d1
    1 U       0    2    0    1
    2 A       1    3    0    2
    3 U       2    4    0    3
    4 C       3    5   20    4


>>>>> files for test RNAs

Similar with training files expect that the 5th column can be meaningless (ignorable).

Example: 

  608  yeast.rRNA_RDN18-1_d1
    1 U       0    2    0    1
    2 A       1    3    0    2
    3 U       2    4    0    3
    4 C       3    5    0    4
    5 U       4    6    0    5
    6 G       5    7    0    6
    7 G       6    8    0    7
    8 U       7    9    0    8
    9 U       8   10    0    9
