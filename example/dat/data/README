# Format of data files

>>>>> files for training RNAs

For 1-dimensional probing data (i.e. SHAPE data), training files contains 5 columns.
    column 1    name of RNA
    column 2    index on the RNA, 1-based
    column 3    reactivity on this base
    column 4    base information in capitals, ACGU
    column 5    structure information for this base, 0 stands for single-standed bases, 1 strands for paired bases

For 2-dimensional probing data (i.e. PARS and DMS-seq data), training files contains 6 columns.
    column 1    name of RNA
    column 2    index on the RNA, 1-based
    column 3    read count 1 for this base, V1 for PARS data and control for DMS-seq data
    column 4    read count 2 for this base, S1 for PARS data and viov for DMS-seq data
    column 5    base information in capitals, ACGU
    column 6    structure information for this base, 0 stands for single-standed bases, 1 strands for paired bases

Note that bases with probing signals are not included in these files


>>>>> files for test RNAs

similar with training files expect that the last column (structure information) is missing.
